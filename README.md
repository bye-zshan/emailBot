"# emailBot" 

I created emailBot just for fun project .
This bot uses smtp.gmail and able to send the email messages to number to people at the same time or time to time .
In this code I specified the email_list and stored the recepient emails in this list but you can import recepient Emails form the scv file (import scv) .
